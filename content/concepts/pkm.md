It is the practice of effectively organizing, managing, and utilizing my personal knowledge and information. It involves various techniques, tools, and strategies that I use to curate information relevant to my learning.

Here are some of the tools essential to my workflow:
1. [[notion|Notion]] as my quick capture app.
2. [[obsidian|Obsidian]] as my note-taking app.
3. [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/faq) as my command centre.

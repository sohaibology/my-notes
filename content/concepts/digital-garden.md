While [digital gardening](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden) has gained popularity among the [[PKM]] community, it is a concept that does not resonate with me. For one, I have a tendency to kill off any plants I try to take care of, so equating it to my learning process does not bode well. Secondly, my [[ADHD]] makes it difficult for me to have the patience to imagine growing a garden. Instead, I prefer the analogy of **[[torch|lighting a torch]]**. It is easy for me to conceptualize the process and visualize the end result â€“ a flame. It starts with igniting your curiosity (the [[spark]]), nurturing your knowledge and generating new ideas (the [[kindling]]). Once the conditions are met, I should have a lit [[torch]] that I can use to light my way, start a fire to cook, etc. A rather more exciting and interactive act for me than tending to a garden.

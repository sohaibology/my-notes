Although the concept of [digital gardening](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden) is quite popular among the [[pkm|personal knowledge management]] community, I am not really a big fan of it. Firstly because I keep killing off any plants I try to grow and secondly, my [[ADHD]] does no allow me the patience to watch a plant grow. I rather prefer the analogy of lighting a torch. These two concepts coincide well together as I elaborate below


While [digital gardening](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden) has gained popularity among the [[PKM]] community, it is a concept that does not resonate with me. For one, I have a tendency to kill off any plants I try to grow, and secondly, my [[ADHD]] makes it difficult for me to have the patience to watch a plant grow. Instead, I prefer the analogy of **[[torch|lighting a torch]]**. It starts with igniting your curiosity (the [[spark]]), nurturing your knowledge and generating new ideas (the [[kindling]]). Like tending to a garden, this process requires consistency and patience.

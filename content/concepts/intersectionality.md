- First coined by Kimberle Crenshaw and rooted more broadly in the writings of black feminists in the United States, the concept of intersectionality has been mobilized to ==move feminist theory and practice beyond an exclusive focus on gender,== and instead to bring into view the wide variety of axes of power and difference that “intersect” within women’s lives.
- The key insight of intersectional feminism is that the identities and oppressions of women cannot be understood simply in terms of gender; rather, the categories of ==race, class, sexuality, ability, nation, and so on, all play an important role in women’s lives==, and have to be taken into account in order to understand the experiences and confront the oppression(s) faced by women.

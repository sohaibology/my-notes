Obsidian is a note-taking app that:
- lets you access your notes offline, for free, forever.
- has countless plugins for organizing and linking your thoughts.
- is completely private so that your notes are not accessible to anyone, including the developers.

I have used over that past four years to collect and link my university notes.

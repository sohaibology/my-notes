Hi there, I'm Sohaib. I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in religious studies as I'm deeply interested in the critical academic study of [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion). I'm also passionate about [pedagogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy), programming, and all things [tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology). You'll often find me immersed in the world of [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management), constantly tinkering and improving my system.
